This repository contains the **Calorie Tracker** app, made by [p3nc1l](https://www.p3nc1l.com).

Feel free to try the app on by visiting [calorie-tracker.p3nc1l.com](https://calorie-tracker.p3nc1l.com)

The application's backend is powered by an API specifically written for it: [p3nc1l/calorie-tracker-backend](https://github.com/p3nc1l/calorie-tracker-backend).

## Introduction

This is a simple calorie tracker app. It's abilities include looking up foods from [FatSecret](https://platform.fatsecret.com/platform-api)'s food API, logging multiple foods as a meal, browsing through the logged meals, setting a daily goal, etc.

Looking up foods from the FatSecret API is made possible by the app's backend [API](https://github.com/p3nc1l/calorie-tracker-backend).

The home page contains important data from that day, such as:

- A hero section saying hi to the user, and informing them about the remaining calorie amount to reach the daily goal.

- A cards section, containing two cards:

  1. Calories card - shows how many calories has the user logged that day out of the daily goal
  2. Nutrients Today card - shows the total amount of Fat, Carbohydrates and Protein consumed that day

### Foods Page

The Foods page allows the user to search for any food available in the database, and see an overview of their nutritional values.

The app displays a total of the 20 most exact results.

### Add/Meal Editor Page

![Add page](/public/README/add-page.png)

The add page allows the user to create a list of foods, that can be logged as a meal, containing the name and time of the meal as well.

As default, the name of the meal is "Meal #*meal number* on *date*". The default time is set as the current time.

![Searching on Add page](/public/README/add-page-search.png)

Searching for foods in the bottom text field lets you add foods from the database to the **Foods Added** list on this page.

Adding a food on the Add page lets you track it's nutritional values as you increase or decrease the quantity, or remove the food from the list.

Clicking on **ADD CUSTOM FOOD** lets you add a blank entry to the list, allowing you to manually enter data, such as it's name, quantity, unit, calories, fat, etc.
